### Phyton - Copy selected text from chrome to excel

I need your help to write a program for windows 10, whenever I select a text in chrome and press "ctrl+c" or any designated key, it will automatically paste the text in a cell below the active cell in excel.

I used phyton to write the code, but it's not functioning.

Hi,

I had fixed your script. Changed and added few libraries. I had attached a video.

Let me know if you want stuff like that

Thanks
