### Python script to print price label.

I want the python script which generates pdf files of barcode label including item name, price, variants from xml file also able to connect to printer and print it.

first it should generate pdf file (can be access later also) and then print it through available printer on same wifi network or connected printer.

XML file will be given by us, XML may contain 1000s of product but using this script we can mainly print chosen PLUs labels we want.( enter data or UPC manually in script and generate label)

Sample of label is attached. label size should be able to change. it should include all types of barcode, code98,code128 etc.

Hi,

You want a python script that reads the xml file and then creates PDF tags and also send command to the printer. Please explain few things below

1- As you mentioned "I want the python script which generates pdf files of barcode label including item name, price, variants from xml file also able to connect to printer and print it."
The xml file you provided has so many tags but I believe the description tag is actually the name and Price tag but there is no variant details I found

2- As you mentioned "but using this script we can mainly print chosen PLUs labels we want.( enter data or UPC manually in script and generate label)"
if you can enter data manually then whats the point of uploading xml. You can easily enter these 3 values in the console and press Enter and the report will be generated accordingly?
If you are going to use xml then how exactly you are willing to view the list of products available in xml. Would you like to have a GUI app that shows the list of products present in the xml you uploaded and then you chose and print barcode tag of any poduct you want.

Please find the attached PDF file on which I had made barcode tags. I can create a console base or GUI app you want with printing fuctionaly as well

Please let me know if I could be any assistance

Thanks
