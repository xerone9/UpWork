### Data extraction from CSV file.

I have a 6.22 gigabyte CSV file, containing around 36 million rows (link available here (link removed)) .
I have a list of about 140,000 id "SIRET numbers" (text file attached).
My goal is to get an Excel file that contains only the 140,000 rows out of the 36 million with siret (column siret) from the text file.
Price for the mission: 5$

Hi,

I see you are looking for a solution that goes through your CSV file and extracts only relevant lines you had uploaded in the text file

I managed to extract those lines but a few of them were missing.

Total Lines Extracted: 139,884
Missing: 143

I am attaching a video here for your reference

Let me know If I could be of any assistance

Thanks
