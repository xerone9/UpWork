### Create a script that groups all phonetically-matching names from a database list of 30,000+ names

I have a database list of over 30,000 first names and their popularity.

I need a script that does two things:
1) Find and group together all phonetically-matching names from this list. Then within each group, put the name that is most popular at the top. In other words, I want to group all names that sound the same when spoken.
2) When providing an input first name (for example, Derik), find the group that either has the exact match name or if there is no exact match, find the group that matches it phonetically (for example, Derick/Deric/Dairek) and return the first name of the group (the most popular)

Find example names database list attached
- Two columns (names, popularity)
- In popularity column, higher the number means more popular
- I can provide a larger list for testing

Hi,

I had made a python script that reads your csv file and did the rest as you explained. I had attached the video. If this is what you are looking for please let me know

Thanks
