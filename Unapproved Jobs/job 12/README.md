## Cover Letter
Hi,

You are looking for someone to scrape the websites provided by you in an Excel Sheet. Scrape relevant data and create another Excel sheet with all the information required in it.

I have tested one website and scrapped the data required by you. I am attaching it here. Let me know if I could be of any assistance

If the duration is too much consider raising the project price and I'll do it in lesser time

Note: I have not tested all the websites just picked a random one and scrapped it.
