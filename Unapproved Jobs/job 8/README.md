### Copy and paste (or manually enter) receipt data into Excel Spreadsheet - $5/hour!

Hello. :)

Your job will be to copy and paste. or manually type in, the information from Home Depot receipts, to a spreadsheet, so I can add up the totals at the end.

All I need is 4 columns of data:

1. $ amount of each item.
2. item description.
3. purchase date.
4. receipt number.

There are over 100 receipts, most receipt have 10 or more items (some less) So there will most likely be over 1,000 rows of data, but it should be fairly quick once you get a rhythm going and have a system for entering the data quickly and efficiently.

Please reply with
1. your name
2. how long you estimate the project will take (a general or approximate estimation is fine) and
3. what experience you have with data entry and record keeping or book keeping.

Thank you :)

Hi,

My name is Usman Mustafa Khawar and I have been working in a University for above 10 years as a data entry operator. My job is to look after all the income flow like student fees, donations and Grants received from government sectors.

I had written a script that automates the task you require. But it is suggested that send me more PDF files to ensure the accuracy of the script

About the duration, well if I manage to automate it, It would be the matter of couple of hours maximum

Please watch the video Attached and let me know if you want something like that

Thanks
