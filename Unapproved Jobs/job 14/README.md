Hi,

I see you are looking for a solution that reads your text files read the values from one file then replaces the values by reading the second file accordingly

I have created a Python Application that does that stuff for you (video attached for reference). I can also create a GUI app too so that all you need to do is browse the text files and it will do the stuff for you.

You haven't mentioned where you want the output file. Shall I create a text file with the results or just flash the results on the screen?

Let me know if I could be of any assistance.

Thanks
