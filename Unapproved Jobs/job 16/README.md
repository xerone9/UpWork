### Research to find company logos. Quick job, 1-2hrs today.

Hi,

Need a little help to quickly google and list of companies (56) and pull their logos from their websites. We need the images for a report being made.

The task is as simple as:

1- Google the name
2- Find their logo
3- Save as a png with the correct name (FullName.png)
4- Add them all to a folder with the format.

Need the job done straight away, please only apply if you can complete in the next few hours. I think it'll be 1-2 hours max work.

Hi,

I see you are looking for a solution in which you provide company names and you want their logos saved in a folder with the company name. I have developed a Python script (Automation) that can do that stuff for you. I have attached a video for your reference in which I supplied 100 company names and it found 87 logos in a minute and failed to find the other 13 (which can be downloaded manually I guess)

If you are going to need this service in the future I can also create a GUI app on which you can select text file with company names and select the folder where you want downloads and it will do the stuff for you

Let me know if I could be of any assistance

Thanks

can you start immediately?
