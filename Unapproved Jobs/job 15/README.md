### Need to automate audio recordings of 1000 words, pronounced by Google

I have a list of 1,000 Spanish words in excel format. Google has a function to pronounce Spanish words (see attached screenshot). I would like you to get me 1,000 mp3 files, each one containing the audio recording of one of these words.

mp3 files need to be recorded at 96kbs CBR mono, and there should be less than 0.1 second of silence in each of these audio files.

In your proposal, tell me how you are planning do this, and how long it will it take to deliver the files. Thanks!

## Cover Letter
Hi,

I hope this proposal finds you well. I am excited to express my interest in the project you've outlined - the creation of 1,000 high-quality MP3 files, each containing an audio recording of a Spanish word. I have thoroughly reviewed your requirements and am confident in my ability to deliver the desired outcome efficiently and effectively.

how you are planning to do this:

I have developed a robust application that is capable of extracting words from Excel files and converting them into MP3 audio files. While Google's pronunciation feature is an option, I have implemented an alternative method to ensure better control over audio quality and consistency. The method involves using high-quality text-to-speech synthesis technology, which allows for fine-tuning audio parameters and eliminating any potential issues with third-party services.

Please Note: I haven't picked audio files from Google format and the mp3 files may also be not in 96kbs CBR mono. But if those are the most utter requirements those need to be done. Please let me know and I'll try working on this as well

I had attached a video for your reference so that you can access how the application is working

how long it will it take to deliver the files?

If you are satisfied with the video. As you can see in the video the application is ready so all we need to do is to feed him words and that's it. It will take a few hours if the process goes smoothly. You can either send me words and I'll convert them or if you want this application yourself you can have it. Message me so that we can discuss
