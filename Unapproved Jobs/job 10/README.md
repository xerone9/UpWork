### Scrape a website for me with Python which I can use in future as website adds new data

You will scrape a website for me to collect data to put into a CSV file. The website is public and easy to work with, though the data is published in PDF form. The pages to be scraped are: FOR HISTORY: https://knowthefactsmmj.com/2022/01/05/2022-ommu-updates/ (each link on this page is a .PDF file with data on page 2) then FOR CURRENT: https://knowthefactsmmj.com/2023/01/05/2023-ommu-updates/

Your code will:

1. Build a history of the data from 2022 to the present
2. Be able to scrape new links as they come into the website.

Thank you!

## Cover Letter
Hi,

You haven't mentioned what you want to extract from page 2. So I assumed that you require table present on page 2.

I had created a bot that scrapped the website you provided downloaded all the pdf files and append them in the csv file.
It took 1.5 mintues to download all 52 files and the took 4.5 minutes to create a csv file

I had attached a video so let me know if you want a stuff like that

Bot working:
1- Will download all the PDF file in upwork folder (should be present on desktop)
2- Then it will rename the files with the dates as actual downloading contains other names
3- Then it will loop through all the pdf files 2nd page only and extract data and place them in the csv file

Adjustments can be made.

Thanks
