# UpWork
 Rejected Proposals...

### _In my prespective Upwork is certainly not sutiable for beginners (by beginners I mean whom just started freelance work)_


## Best Thing About UpWork:
You can actually read the job. Unlike other freelance platforms where you post your gig and then wait that someone might need that kind of service you posted in your gig and buy it. But there is a catch, let say you are web developer so you posted your gig but ofcourse there are so many domains for web. A normal informative webiste or woo-commerce business website or database related websites or even a game that meant to be run on webservers so you might not know every single side of website development. But in Upwork you can read whats the need of client and then apply for it so its difinitely a win win situation that you can apply for a job you know you can do.

### Worst Thing about upwork _that makes me left upwork_
## Connects system
So eventhoug the platform is free yet its not free unlike other platforms that charge a specific percent of what you sell. UpWork not even charge 15% of whatever amount you received from the clients but also to apply for the job you need to have connects. If you dont have connects you cant apply. Okay if I have no connects my proposal should come in last BUT NO... you can litterally cant apply for jobs if you dont have connect
Unlike other plaforms you have to pay 1 connect per day to set your status to online. If you dont pay eventhough you are online all the time to upwork still you'll appear as offline
When I started I had 160 connects I bought other 25 connects. I got only 1 job and have only 2 connects left now so...
